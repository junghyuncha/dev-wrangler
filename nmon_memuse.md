# Memory Usage Analysis with nmon: Understanding `memuse`

## Overview

The `memuse` section in `nmon` provides detailed metrics related to memory utilization on AIX and Linux systems. It is crucial for diagnosing memory pressure, optimizing performance, and identifying areas for system tuning.

## Key Fields

| Field          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%numperm`     | Percentage of memory used by the file system's persistent (perm) cache.     |
| `%minperm`     | Minimum threshold under which the system tries to free perm memory.         |
| `%maxperm`     | Maximum allowed memory usage by perm cache.                                 |
| `%numclient`   | Percentage of memory used by client applications.                           |
| `%maxclient`   | Maximum memory limit for client memory usage.                               |
| `minfree`      | Minimum number of free pages the system tries to maintain.                  |
| `maxfree`      | Maximum number of free pages the system allows before reducing allocation.  |
| `lruable pages`| Total number of pages that can be reclaimed via LRU (Least Recently Used).  |

## Why It Matters

Monitoring `memuse` helps system administrators:
- Identify when memory limits are being exceeded
- Detect potential causes of system slowness (e.g. page stealing)
- Adjust memory tuning parameters via tools like `vmo` on AIX

## Example Snapshot

```text
%numperm:     94.3
%minperm:     3.0
%maxperm:     90.0
%numclient:   89.1
%maxclient:   90.0
minfree:      960
maxfree:      1088
lruable pages: 130171072
```

## Analysis

In the example above:
- `%numperm` exceeds `%maxperm`, suggesting the file system cache is overutilized. This could lead to paging activity and I/O bottlenecks.
- `%numclient` is close to `%maxclient`, indicating high application memory pressure.
- The system may experience page stealing, affecting overall performance.

## Recommendations

- **Tune memory parameters**: Adjust `maxperm`, `maxclient`, or `minfree` with system commands like `vmo` (AIX).
- **Monitor trends**: Persistent high usage may require physical memory upgrades or application optimization.
- **Automate alerts**: Use thresholds and monitoring scripts to detect and respond to excessive usage.
